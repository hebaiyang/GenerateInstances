This project generates test instances for the project "KnapsackProblem_NEDP" of research "Numerically exact dynamic programming for knapsack problems over rational numbers". 
The generated instances are stored in four folders: "dataset1", "dataset2", "dataset3" and "dataset4". 
The instance data in these four folders are used for the numerical experiments in Sections 3.1-3.4.
